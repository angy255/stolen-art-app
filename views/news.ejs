    <p id="title2">Priceless Masterpieces Vanish Overnight from the Louvre Museum</p>
    <p class="news-title">PARIS, France — <span>On October 19th, 2025, the world's most visited museum was turned into a crime scene.
</span></p>
    <p class="story">In what authorities are calling one of the most daring art thefts in decades, several priceless works were stolen from the Louvre Museum in the early hours of Sunday morning.
    According to police officials, at least three paintings — including works believed to be by Leonardo da Vinci, Eugène Delacroix, and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres — vanished sometime between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. after the museum's security systems were "temporarily disabled." </p>

    Witnesses reported seeing a black van speeding away from the museum's Seine-side entrance shortly before dawn. The Louvre has been placed under tight lockdown, and the French Ministry of Culture has convened an emergency press conference. "This is a blow not just to France, but to the cultural heritage of humanity," said Culture Minister Élodie Marchand, speaking from outside the museum's glass pyramid. "We will spare no effort to recover what has been stolen."Forensic teams and art crime investigators from INTERPOL have joined local authorities in what is already being described as a meticulously planned inside job. Early reports suggest that no alarms were triggered, leading experts to suspect that the thieves may have had access to internal security codes or museum floor plans. As news spreads, crowds have begun to gather outside the Louvre, leaving flowers and notes at the entrance. </p>

    One tourist, Martin Alvarez from Spain, described the atmosphere as "surreal — like a scene out of a movie." The Louvre's most famous painting, the Mona Lisa, remains unharmed and under increased protection in a reinforced vault. Officials declined to confirm whether the theft targeted a specific upcoming exhibition or if it was a broader attack on the museum's collection. Authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious art sales or offers. A €10 million reward has been announced for information leading to the recovery of the stolen works.
